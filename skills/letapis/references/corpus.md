# Keeping a corpus

An engine answers about what it was told to watch. This page is the other half of that: deciding
what belongs in the index, adding and removing it, following the long jobs that do the work, and
retiring material that should stop surfacing without deleting anything.

None of it is daily work. All of it is what stands behind an answer that came back thin.


## What is in the index

```python
mcp__<engine>__list_folders()                 # what this engine actually watches
mcp__<engine>__index_folder(path="/path/to/folder", generate_embeddings=True)
mcp__<engine>__get_indexing_progress(path="/path/to/folder")
mcp__<engine>__update_folder(path="/path/to/folder", ignore_patterns=["**/fixtures/**"])
mcp__<engine>__remove_folder(path="/path/to/folder")
mcp__<engine>__get_embedding_errors(limit=50)
```

**`list_folders` is the answer to "is this indexed", and it is worth asking before concluding
something does not exist.** When the material you need is in no engine at all, name the source you
would want added — deciding to index it belongs to whoever runs the corpus, and a precise name
makes that decision easy.

**Its rows carry more than paths, and each field answers a question you would otherwise guess at:**

| Field | What it tells you |
|---|---|
| `active` | a watch can be listed and switched off. An inactive folder answers nothing, and the row looks entirely normal |
| `files_indexed` · `last_update` | how much is actually in there and when it was last touched. Zero files, or a date months old, is a diagnosis rather than a detail |
| `ignore_patterns` | what was deliberately excluded **for this folder** — the single most common reason a file sits in a watched folder and never appears. It is one layer of several, and it is the only one you set here; see below |
| `recursive` | whether the watch descends into subdirectories or holds only the top level. A false here explains a subtree that was never indexed and never reported missing |
| `odoo_aware` | whether this folder is parsed with framework-specific extraction, which decides what the call graph can see in it |
| `episodes` | whether documents here are remembered as events — see below. Off unless somebody said otherwise |
| `description` | free text about why this folder is watched, left by whoever added it. Useful, and no fresher than the day it was written |
| `nested_under` · `has_nested` | whether this folder sits inside another watch, or contains its own |
| `groups` | **not in these rows** — group tags are set on the folder with `update_folder(path, groups=[…])` and read back with `list_groups`. They are a search-time label rather than a property of the index, and what they are for is in [search](search.md) § Narrowing |

### What is excluded, and by which layer

A file is turned away by more than one mechanism, and only the last of them is per-folder: the
engine's built-in list, the machine's `indexing.exclude_patterns`, a set of binary extensions and
file names refused before anything is read, and finally the folder's own `ignore_patterns`.

```python
mcp__<engine>__list_folders()        # the per-folder layer
mcp__<engine>__ignore_patterns()     # all layers, each one named and explained
```

**A folder is taken WHOLE.** Build output, test-expectation files, notebooks and vendored copies
are indexed as eagerly as sources, so look at what is in there before adding it — that is part of
the job rather than a precaution. The moment of adding is also the cheapest moment to narrow it.

**Adding a folder is three steps, and the first one is not `index_folder`.**

1. **Look at what is there.** The folder sits on the engine's filesystem, not yours, so its own
   instrument is what shows you: `workspace_browse(path=…)` (§ Bringing material onto the engine).
   A listing on your own machine describes a different directory that happens to share a name.
2. **Choose which of the two selectors fits — they are not interchangeable** (below).
3. **Index, and read what comes back.** The engine judges your patterns against the folder's real
   files and names the ones that add nothing (§ Ask before you write).

**Two selectors, and the choice is made from what you know about the tree.**

| Selector | Reach for it when | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `file_patterns` — name what you take | you do not know the contents, but you know what you took the folder **for** | a list of what you do not want is never complete on an unfamiliar tree: every pass turns up a kind of clutter the last one had no reason to expect |
| `ignore_patterns` — name what you skip | the tree is yours or familiar, and the surplus is a short, known list | everything is worth having except the build and output directories you can name — and a whitelist here would cut material you did want |

**Neither is the default.** A whitelist on a tree you know well throws away the file types you
forgot to list; a blacklist on a tree you do not know keeps whatever you failed to anticipate. The
question to answer before choosing is simply which of the two lists you can actually write.

**A whitelist matches the file NAME, not its path.** `*.py` works; `src/*.py` matches nothing at
all — directories are not its business (see below), so a path-shaped pattern has nothing it could
ever match. The mistake is easy to make and easy to catch: it turns every file in the folder away,
so the `pattern_misses` below comes back equal to the whole tree.

**Neither selector discards in silence, but they account for it differently, and the difference
matters.** The answer from `index_folder` carries `pattern_misses` — how many files the whitelist
turned away — whenever that is not zero. Read it: a number far larger than you expected means the
pattern is narrower than you meant, and it is the cheapest correction you will ever get.

The blacklist reports `ignored_files` and `ignored_dirs`, and the second one is a count of
**directories, not of what was in them**. A pruned tree is not walked, so its contents are never
numbered — deliberately, since walking a vendored dependency directory to number what you skipped
costs more than knowing. So: after a whitelist you know exactly what you lost; after a blacklist
you know how many doors you closed, not what was behind them.

**They combine because they work at different levels, not because it happens to be convenient.**
The blacklist is applied to every entry before anything asks whether it is a file or a directory,
so a matched directory is skipped *and never descended into*. The whitelist is consulted only for
files. Neither can do the other's job: a whitelist cannot stop a walk, and a blacklist cannot say
what a folder was taken for.

The practical consequence is the shape you will want most often. Naming extensions still leaves
directories made of exactly those extensions — `tests/`, `fixtures/`, `reports/` — and only the
blacklist can cut those, because only it reaches directories.

```python
mcp__<engine>__index_folder(
    path="/path/on/the/engine",
    file_patterns=["*.py", "*.md"],          # what this folder was taken for
    ignore_patterns=["tests/", "reports/"],  # directories made of exactly those
)
```

**What guessing costs — one unfamiliar repository, three passes:**

| Pass | What was declared | What was indexed |
|---|---|---|
| first | nothing | 568 files, 31 571 chunks — benchmark runs and model weights among them |
| second | ignore rules for the clutter that first pass revealed | still 2 011 chunks of built JavaScript, from six files |
| third | `*.py`, `*.md` | 272 files, 1 624 chunks |

**The middle pass is the argument.** The ignore rules were written by the same person who then
wrote the whitelist, after having seen the first result — and they still missed a whole category.
Not for want of care: there is nothing to guess an unfamiliar tree's contents *from*. The third
pass did not need to guess, because it asked a different question — not "what is in here that I
do not want", but "what did I come here for".

**Ask before you write.** Most patterns written into a folder by hand turn out to add nothing:
either a layer above already catches what they catch, or nothing in that folder matches them at
all. Writing them costs nothing and is easy to keep doing for years, since the layers above are
not visible from the folder.

`index_folder` and `update_folder` judge your patterns **against that folder's real files** —
remove the pattern, would anything reach the index that did not before. Each one that adds nothing
comes back with which of two cases it is: **nothing here matches it**, or **already caught by**
a named rule. The first has no rule to name, because nothing in the folder reached the question.
They drop none of your patterns. When a folder is empty, missing, or too large to walk, the answer
says it is **not judging** rather than returning an empty list, which would read as "every one of
yours is needed".

**The built-in list is deliberately basic.** It covers what nearly every tree has and carries
nothing for Xcode, Java, .NET or your framework's cache directory. When you add a folder from a
stack the engine has never heard of, look at what its build writes and name it yourself: build
output of that kind runs to tens of thousands of indexable files, and it competes with your
sources in the results rather than sitting quietly beneath them.

**A folder can overrule the machine.** The lists are glued in one order — the built-in list, the
machine's config, then the folder's own rules — and the last line that matches wins, so a folder
cancels a pattern from either list above it by writing `!<pattern>` among its own. Two things no
`!` reaches: the version control directories, which sit below the folder, and the sets matching by
file extension or file name, which are not part of the pattern list at all. `ignore_patterns()`
names every layer and says which of them a folder may overrule.

### Whether a folder grows memory

Indexing a folder and remembering what happens in it are two different decisions, and `episodes`
is where the second one is made:

```python
mcp__<engine>__index_folder(path="/path/to/vault", episodes=True)     # from the start
mcp__<engine>__update_folder(path="/path/to/vault", episodes=True)    # or later
```

**The flag decides one thing only: whether a document counts as an event.** Indexing and search
are unaffected either way — an unmarked folder is watched, chunked, embedded and searchable
exactly as a marked one is; its documents simply do not become episodes. What episodes are, and
what a document needs in its frontmatter to become one, is in [memory](memory.md).

**The default is no, and it is set on the root of a watch.** A file belongs to the watched folder
whose path is its longest prefix, so marking the root covers the tree below it, and a nested watch
overrides its parent for its own subtree. A document nobody claims is not remembered: memory grows
only where someone said it should.

Changing the flag applies from the next indexing pass. Episodes already recorded stay — turning it
off stops new ones rather than retracting old ones.

**Do not mark the folder the engine writes its own memory into.** Episodes are persisted as files
there, and a marked folder reads those files as documents — so each episode produces a second
episode about the same event, and that one is a document too. Nothing announces it: recall keeps
answering, and the twins look like ordinary results until someone counts. Duplicates accumulate at
the rate the folder is written to, so a busy vault reaches hundreds within weeks. The same caution
applies to any folder holding material generated by the engine rather than written by a person.

### Long jobs run in the background, and you have to collect them

Indexing a folder does not finish inside the call. It returns an **`operation_id`**, and the work
continues on the engine:

```python
op = mcp__<engine>__index_folder(path="/path/to/folder", generate_embeddings=True)
mcp__<engine>__get_operation(operation_id=op["operation_id"])   # status · phase · progress · result
mcp__<engine>__list_operations()                                # everything in flight right now
mcp__<engine>__cancel_operation(operation_id=…)                 # stops at the next safe boundary
```

**A call that returned is not a job that finished.** Treating the return value as completion is how
a search gets run against a half-built index and comes back thin — which looks exactly like "there
is little about this here". `get_operation` carries the final result in its detail once the status
says completed; `cancel_operation` stops cleanly and keeps whatever was already done.

### Paths are the engine's, not yours

The engine may run on another machine or inside a container, and it reports paths as **it** sees
them. When a path from a hit does not resolve on your disk, `fetch_file(path=…)` pulls the file
from the engine rather than leaving you to work out the mapping. And every call that takes a
folder wants the path exactly as `list_folders` reports it — not the one you would type.

### Two versions of one thing are two worlds with one set of paths

Indexing two releases of the same library, framework or product is a normal and useful thing to
do. What it costs is that **a question about either matches both**, and nothing in the answer
marks the difference: file paths repeat, symbol names repeat, prose repeats. On such a corpus one
broad question returned eight hits with five from the release that was not the subject; two of the
eight were the same chunk in both, one identifier apart, scored 0.000013 apart.

There is no ranking fix for this, because both hits are honest. The corpus-side remedy is to make
the difference nameable before anyone asks:

```python
mcp__<engine>__update_folder(path="/corpus/lib-2.0", groups=["current"])
mcp__<engine>__update_folder(path="/corpus/lib-1.4", groups=["legacy"])
```

After that a query can say which world it means — `groups=["current"]`, or
`exclude_groups=["legacy"]` — instead of relying on whoever reads the answer to check the path.
Tagging is a search-time label, so it takes effect immediately and costs no reindexing.

**The same applies to any pair the corpus holds twice**: a vendored copy beside the original, a
fork beside upstream, a generated tree beside its source. If two folders can answer the same
question and only one of them should, that is what group tags are for.

## Retiring material that should stop surfacing

Archived plans, superseded designs and deprecated docs keep answering queries long after they
stopped being true. `forget_document` hides one from search **without touching the file on disk**.

```python
mcp__<engine>__forget_document(path="/path/to/archive/old_plan.md",
                               reason="superseded by the 2026 rewrite; kept for history")
```

The file node is marked, and the mark cascades to every chunk of it; search excludes them by
default. You can still open the file directly, and the audit trail can find it again.

| Someone says | What it means |
|---|---|
| "why does this old doc keep coming up" | stale — hide it |
| "this is out of date" / "deprecated" / "we removed that" | same |
| "we archived that plan, it should not surface" | same |
| results keep coming from an `*_archive/` path | worth proposing proactively |

**Related calls:** `forget_folder(folder, reason)` hides a whole subtree in one go;
`restore_document` and `restore_folder` undo either; `list_forgotten_documents` shows the audit
trail with the reason and the time.

**Write the reason for the person who finds it in a year** — same discipline, and the same
worked examples, as for correcting a memory: [memory](memory.md) § Write the reason.

**Two edge cases worth knowing.** Editing a forgotten file regenerates its chunks: existing ones keep
the mark, new ones do not, so re-run the call after a substantial edit. And do not forget a
document you have not read — "looks old" and "is superseded" are different claims, and only one
of them survives someone asking why the answer disappeared.

## Bringing material onto the engine

Indexing needs the material to be on the machine the engine runs on, which is not always the
machine you are on. For source you do not have yet, the engine can fetch and track it itself:

```python
mcp__<engine>__git_clone(url="https://…/project", branch="main", depth=1)   # shallow by default
mcp__<engine>__git_pull(path="/path/on/the/engine")                          # fast-forward only
mcp__<engine>__git_fetch(path="/path/on/the/engine")
mcp__<engine>__git_status(path="/path/on/the/engine")                        # branch, ahead/behind
mcp__<engine>__workspace_browse(path="/path")                                # what is on the node
mcp__<engine>__list_workspace_folders()                                      # watched folders, git-aware
```

**A clone is not an index.** Fetching a repository puts files on the node; the engine only answers
about them after `index_folder`. The reverse trap costs more: a watched clone that nobody pulls
answers confidently from the state it had when it arrived — the index is fresh, the source is
stale, and nothing in the answer says so. `git_status` is what tells you which.

## When the index and the disk disagree

An index can fall out of step with the files it was built from, and the symptoms read as engine
faults: a hit pointing at a line that has moved, material plainly indexed that never matches by
meaning. What to read in each case, and which operations change state rather than report on it,
is in [admin](admin.md) — it is not repeated here.
