"""Three tools stay in the window, and the rest of the surface arrives on demand.

The proxy marks a named few with ``_meta: {"anthropic/alwaysLoad": true}`` so the
client keeps their descriptions loaded once the SERVER-level `alwaysLoad` is off.

Every assertion here reads the mark the way the client will — through
``model_dump(by_alias=True, exclude_none=True)`` — and not by touching the
attribute, because the attribute existing is not the same as the field crossing
the wire under the name the client looks for.

The tool names are written out as literals rather than imported from
``srv.ALWAYS_LOADED``. A test that reads the same list it guards goes green together
with it: empty the constant and a constant-driven test simply stops checking
anything. `test_the_constant_holds_exactly_these_three` is the one place that compares
the two, so a deliberate change fails loudly there and nowhere else.
